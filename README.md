### Hello there 👋

<!--
**axelgueudin/axelgueudin** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

I'm axel, a french designer experimenting & trying to learn new cool stuff.
Currently, I spend my time learning, to be a better UI Artist to get a job, in the video game industry 🎮


🔭 I’m currently working on my serious game,  [Biotica](https://axelgueudin.github.io/biotica "Biotica website") & on others projects (Project Gaia, a video game UI concept / illustrations / Beer packaging ...) 

🌱 I’m currently learning UI for video games, vfx, 3D, creative coding & more!
